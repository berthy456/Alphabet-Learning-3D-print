# Alphabet-Learning-3D-print

Inspired by the pictograms hidden in "l'infini" font, I decided to make them printable, mostly because it could be usefull for learning children.

Please note that pictograms are mostly representing french objects (Arrosoir for A, Dé for D, Usine for U, etc..). It'd be nice to have english and other language too but I don't know any font or picture bank on that particular topic. Feel free to send me a message if you know a similar work in your language.

# Just print the "Relief" folder's 26 STLs!
Can be printed in 2 colors using a pause on the last (2) layer.

This is a work in progress, maybe the design will evolve and i will add colors.

Based on the beautiful Infini font by Sandrine Nugue for the CNAP.

Many thanks to her for this work!

Sample of what Françoise Lapierre Baillet done for ink/stitch (inkscape stitching plugin), applying some personalisation and colors to the fonts, make it very cool too:

Just download and print either the "Picto letter" or "Relief letter" folder's STL files.

My work is mainly redesigning the "relief" folder's files, to make the letters a little bit easier to read.
The last 0.4 mm of the "relief" files are supposed to be printed in another color, for readability too.

I used mostly openscad, but also had to model on freecad for some letters ( adding support for printing, etc..).
