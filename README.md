# Alphabet-Learning-3D-print


Now bicolor print is possible using Relief folder's files!

Some efforts to design the 26 latin letters in 3D using a pictographic font.

This is a work in progress maybe the design will evolve and i will add colors.

Based on the beautifull Infini font by Sandrine Nugue.

Many thanks to her for this work and having published it under Creative Commons CC BY-ND licensing!

Just download and print either the "Picto letter" or "Relief letter" folder's STL files.

My work is mainly redesigning the "relief" folder's files, to make the letters a little bit easier to read.
The last 0.4 mm of the "relief" files are supposed to be printed in another color, for readability too.

I used mostly openscad, but also had to model on freecad for some letters ( adding support for printing, etc..).
