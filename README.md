# Alphabet-Learning-3D-print

Some efforts to design the 26 latin letters in 3D using a pictographic font.

Pictograms are mostly representing french objects (DÃ© for D, Usine for U). I 'd be nice to have english too if someone have an idea.

# Just print the "Relief" folder's 26 STLs!
Can be printed in 2 colors using a pause on the last (2) layer.

This is a work in progress, maybe the design will evolve and i will add colors.

Based on the beautifull Infini font by Sandrine Nugue for the CNAP.

Many thanks to her for this work!

Sample of what the ink/stich team done, applying some colors to the fonts make it nice too.

Just download and print either the "Picto letter" or "Relief letter" folder's STL files.

My work is mainly redesigning the "relief" folder's files, to make the letters a little bit easier to read.
The last 0.4 mm of the "relief" files are supposed to be printed in another color, for readability too.

I used mostly openscad, but also had to model on freecad for some letters ( adding support for printing, etc..).
