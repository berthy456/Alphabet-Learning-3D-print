Just download and print either the "letter-picto" or "letter-relief" folder's STL files.

My work is mainly redesigning the "relief" folder's files, to make the letters a little bit easier to read.

I used mostly openscad, but also had to model on freecad for some letters ( adding support for printing, etc..).
